This is a Python program to calculate the elastic parameters of orthorhombic crystals using sound velocity measurements.

It takes inputs such as velocity values, the density of the crystal, and the lattice dimensions from the user.

The program calculates key physical properties of the crystal, including:

Elastic stiffness constants (C),
Compliance constants (S),
Poisson’s ratios,
Young’s modulus (E).
Bulk modulus,
Compressibility

The user can execute each cell in the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file), and upon running the final cell, a PDF report is generated containing a summary of all the calculated elastic parameter values for the orthorhombic crystal.
